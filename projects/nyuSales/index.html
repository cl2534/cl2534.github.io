                        <p>  On July 22, 2017, we competed in Jane Street’s electronic trading challenge and placed 6th out of 45 teams. <br>
                            The goal of the competition was to create an electronic trading bot to make money by buying/selling securities
                            on a simulated financial market. The market is consisted of 7 ticker symbols: BOND, GOOL, MSFT, AAPL, XLK, NOKFH,
                            and NOKUS: one bond, four stocks and two mutual funds.

                        </p>
                        <ul> <b> Finance Concepts </b>
                            <span id="tab">
                                <li> Fair Value: the intrinsic value of the stock, which is the correct potential value that is believed to be unbiased and rational.  </li>
                                <li> Market Value:  the price point of the stock in which it can be bought or sold. </li>
                                <li> Bid-Ask Value: Bid price can be understood as the highest price a dealer is willing to pay for a stock, and ask price is the lowest price a dealer is willing to sell for a stock. The difference between the highest bid and lowest ask is spread. </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4> Our Strategies </h4>
                        <span id="tab"> <b>1) Pennying (Penny-pinching) </b></span>
                        <p> <span id="tab"><span id="tab"> There are couple of trading bots written by Jane St called marketplace bots. These bots represent the people who just seek to buy and sell the securities for purposes such as portfolio management, cash flow management, etc. These people tend to be less price sensitive, and therefore the traders can take advantage of it. <br>
                            The bond’s fair value can be correctly calculated by its entire cash flow. Since the focus of this competition is trading instead of investing, how the bond’s fair value works is irrelevant and therefore given by the documentation that’s given.  <br>
                            The simple strategy of penny is to set a bid price that’s slightly lower than the fair value, set an ask price that’s slightly higher than the fair value. So you’d be start earning the price differences. Think of this strategy as simple ticket scalping. Buy low. Sell high.<br>
                            Note: the size of each order matters a lot. When there are different traders on the market submitting orders with the same price, the first one who submits will be the first one on the queue, and the second one can only be traded when the first order is complete, given that the second order’s price is still the highest bid or lowest ask. <br>
                         </p>

                        <span id="tab"> <b> 2) Price Predicting </b></span>
                        <p> <span id="tab"><span id="tab"> This is not predicting the future stock price based on its past performance.
                            This is using the market value of a more liquid asset to estimate the fair value of the less liquid asset,
                            given that these two assets have the same fair value. The market value of the less liquid asset is usually
                             different from the fair value, and we can buy the less liquid asset when its market value is less than the
                             calculated fair value. Vice Versa
                        </p>

                        <span id="tab"> <b> 3) Arbitrage </b> </span>
                        <p> <span id="tab"><span id="tab"> This strategy is to simultaneously buying mutual fund and sell its underlying stock or vice versa,
                            effectively hedging the risk of stocks’ price movement, while increasing the position limit multi-folds.
                            we needed to be aware of the conversion fee when we were using this strategy.
                        </p>
